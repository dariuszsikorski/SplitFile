#Split files#
##split sections of code into separate files##

Split files can split sections from input file to separate files and folders. This feature is useful if you want to store multiple parts of code in one file and export them into separate files.

Example usage: writing component which combine html, javaScript, css and documentation in one file and split each section into file with proper extension (like component.html, component.js, .component.css, ./doc/component_readme.md).

##Installation##
`
npm install splitfiles
